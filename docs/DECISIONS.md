# Decisions

Technical decisions and why, newest last. Format: what we chose, why, what we gave up.

## 2026-10-12: Scaffold

**Monorepo with `/api`, `/web`, `/desktop`.** One repo, one PR flow, and the desktop shell
needs both parts anyway. `/desktop` arrives in its own step.

**GitFlow on `master`/`develop`, never `main`.** The initial commit went directly onto
`master` (explicit exception, needed so `develop` could exist). Everything after that goes
through `feature/*` PRs into `develop`.

**API: FastAPI + uv + Python 3.12.** The machine default is 3.14, but the project pins 3.12
(`.python-version`, `requires-python >=3.12`) because the transcription and packaging
dependencies (Whisper engines, PyInstaller) are most likely to ship wheels for 3.12. Not yet
verified for each one; revisit in the model spike.

**API config: only `SCOPEWISE_*` environment variables, via pydantic-settings.** Port, data
dir, models dir, Ollama URL and CORS origins have no defaults in code, so the app fails fast
instead of silently assuming a port or the default Ollama URL (the packaged binary must not
assume anything). The only default is the bind address, `127.0.0.1`. `make dev` supplies
dev values.

**One entrypoint for dev and packaged builds: `python -m app`.** It reads the same settings
and runs uvicorn on `settings.host:settings.port`, so PyInstaller can wrap the same module.

**CORS is configurable, not open.** The Nuxt dev server (`localhost:3000`) calls the api on
another port, so the allowed origins come from `SCOPEWISE_CORS_ORIGINS`. The desktop shell
will set it for the packaged app.

**API tooling: ruff (lint + format), mypy strict with the pydantic plugin, pytest.** Small
and fast; no extra config layer.

**HTTP client: `httpx`.** Starlette's test client prints a deprecation warning suggesting
`httpx2` (a newer client from the Pydantic org). We did not adopt it: it is an unfamiliar
dependency pulled in by a warning, and `httpx` works. Revisit if the warning becomes an
error.

**Web: Nuxt 4 (latest stable, 4.6.1) in SPA mode (`ssr: false`), TypeScript strict.**
`nuxt generate` produces static files in `.output/public` for Electron to load. Verified
that generation works.

**Web package manager: npm.** Already installed; pnpm is not, and installing it globally is
not worth the time. Lockfile is committed.

**Web tooling: `@nuxt/eslint`, `vue-tsc` via `nuxt typecheck`, vitest.** `nuxt typecheck`
and `eslint` need `nuxt prepare` (runs on `npm install` through `postinstall`).

**API base URL resolution.** `useApi()` uses `window.desktop?.apiBase` when the desktop
preload provides it, otherwise `runtimeConfig.public.apiBase` (dev default
`http://127.0.0.1:8765`, override with `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`). The name `window.desktop`
is provisional; the desktop step defines the real preload contract and updates this.

**Dev workflow: one `Makefile`.** `make setup`, `make dev` (api + web together, after
checking Ollama), plus `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `format`. Ollama runs natively on macOS
in development so it can use the Apple Silicon GPU; it is not run in Docker.

**Dev api port is 8765, not 8000.** Docker Desktop listens on `*:8000` (IPv6) on the dev
Mac, so `localhost:8000` could reach the wrong service. Everything uses `127.0.0.1`
explicitly, and the port is only a dev default (`SCOPEWISE_PORT`); the packaged app picks a
free port at runtime.

**Ollama health check uses `GET /api/tags`.** It is documented in the official Ollama API
reference and doubles as the list of local models. We did not find `/api/version` in the
docs, so we do not use it.

## 2026-10-13: Claude Code memory

**`CLAUDE.md` is short (53 lines) and committed; scope-specific rules are path-scoped files.**
The official memory docs recommend under 200 lines and say rules with a `paths` frontmatter
field load only when Claude touches matching files. So `.claude/rules/api.md` (`api/**`) and
`.claude/rules/web.md` (`web/**`) carry the per-part rules, and `desktop.md` arrives with the
desktop step. Only what cannot be inferred from the code is written down.

**`CLAUDE.local.md` keeps the full challenge brief plus a machine-specific section.** The
plan was for it to hold only machine settings. The brief (product flow, build order) is long
and mostly useful to the person building, so it stays local rather than shipping in the
public repo; `CLAUDE.md` carries the condensed rules. Revisit if the brief should be public.
